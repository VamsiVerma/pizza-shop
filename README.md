# Pizza Shop Simulation project.
Have a look on my simple project on https://5rdf5j-3000.csb.app/

## Functionalities done:

1.  Placing a order from input form.
2.  At max 10 orders
3.  Dynamic Stage mocement with timer .
4.  Showing time spent in each stage with each pizza card
5.  Once the order is picked it is removed from main section and total deliveries increased by 1.
6.  if order is cancelled before going to "order Ready" state it gets removed.
7.  orders are sorted based on delay time
8.  used redux
